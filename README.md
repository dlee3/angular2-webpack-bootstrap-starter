## File Structure
We use the component approach in our starter. This is the new standard for developing Angular apps and a great way to ensure maintainable code by encapsulation of our behavior logic. A component is basically a self contained app usually in a single file or a folder with each concern as a file: style, template, specs, e2e, and component class. Here's how it looks:
```
angular4-webpack-starter/
 ├──config/                        * our configuration
 |   ├──helpers.js                 * helper functions for our configuration files
 |   ├──spec-bundle.js             * ignore this magic that sets up our angular 4 testing environment

# Getting Started
## Dependencies
What you need to run this app:
* `node` and `npm` (`brew install node`)
* Ensure you're running the latest versions Node `v4.x.x`+ (or `v5.x.x`) and NPM `3.x.x`+

> If you have `nvm` installed, which is highly recommended (`brew install nvm`) you can do a `nvm install --lts && nvm use` in `$` to run with the latest Node LTS. You can also have this `zsh` done for you [automatically](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#calling-nvm-use-automatically-in-a-directory-with-a-nvmrc-file) 

Once you have those, you should install these globals with `npm install --global`:
* `webpack` (`npm install --global webpack`)
* `webpack-dev-server` (`npm install --global webpack-dev-server`)
* `karma` (`npm install --global karma-cli`)
* `protractor` (`npm install --global protractor`)
* `typescript` (`npm install --global typescript`)

## Installing
* `fork` this repo
* `clone` your fork
* `yarn global add webpack-dev-server rimraf webpack` to install required global dependencies
* `yarn install` to install all dependencies
* `yarn server` to start the dev server in another tab

## Running the app
After you have installed all dependencies you can now run the app. Run `npm run server` to start a local server using `webpack-dev-server` which will watch, build (in-memory), and reload for you. The port will be displayed to you as `http://0.0.0.0:3000` (or if you prefer IPv6, if you're using `express` server, then it's `http://[::1]:3000/`).

### server
```bash
# development
yarn server
# production
yarn build:prod
yarn server:prod
```

## Other commands

### build files
```bash
# development
yarn build:dev
# production (jit)
yarn build:prod
# AoT
yarn build:aot
```

### hot module replacement
```bash
yarn dev
```

### watch and build files
```bash
yarn watch
```

### run unit tests
```bash
yarn test
```

### watch and run our tests
```bash
yarn watch:test
```

### run end-to-end tests
```bash
# update Webdriver (optional, done automatically by postinstall script)
yarn webdriver:update
# this will start a test server and launch Protractor
yarn e2e
```

### continuous integration (run unit tests and e2e tests together)
```bash
# this will test both your JIT and AoT builds
yarn ci
```

### run Protractor's elementExplorer (for end-to-end)
```bash
yarn e2e:live
```

### build Docker
```bash
yarn build:docker
```

# Configuration
Configuration files live in `config/` we are currently using webpack, karma, and protractor for different stages of your application

# AoT Don'ts
The following are some things that will make AoT compile fail.

- Don’t use require statements for your templates or styles, use styleUrls and templateUrls, the angular2-template-loader plugin will change it to require at build time.
- Don’t use default exports.
- Don’t use `form.controls.controlName`, use `form.get(‘controlName’)`
- Don’t use `control.errors?.someError`, use `control.hasError(‘someError’)`
- Don’t use functions in your providers, routes or declarations, export a function and then reference that function name
- @Inputs, @Outputs, View or Content Child(ren), Hostbindings, and any field you use from the template or annotate for Angular should be public

# Global Stylesheets
Any stylesheets (Sass or CSS) placed in the `src/styles` directory and imported into your project will automatically be compiled into an external `.css` and embedded in your production builds. These styles will be applied globally to your app.

# Contributing
You can include more examples as components but they must introduce a new concept such as `Home` component (separate folders), and Todo (services). I'll accept pretty much everything so feel free to open a Pull-Request

# TypeScript
> To take full advantage of TypeScript with autocomplete you would have to install it globally and use an editor with the correct TypeScript plugins.

## Use latest TypeScript compiler
TypeScript 2.1.x includes everything you need. Make sure to upgrade, even if you installed TypeScript previously.

```
yarn add typescript -g
```

## Use a TypeScript-aware editor
We have good experience using these editors:

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Webstorm 10](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download/)
* [Atom](https://atom.io/) with [TypeScript plugin](https://atom.io/packages/atom-typescript)
* [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) with [Typescript-Sublime-Plugin](https://github.com/Microsoft/Typescript-Sublime-plugin#installation)

### Visual Studio Code + Debugger for Chrome
> Install [Debugger for Chrome](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome) and see docs for instructions to launch Chrome 

The included `.vscode` automatically connects to the webpack development server on port `3000`.

# Types
> When you include a module that doesn't include Type Definitions inside of the module you can include external Type Definitions with @types

i.e, to have youtube api support, run this command in terminal: 
```shell
npm i @types/youtube @types/gapi @types/gapi.youtube
``` 
In some cases where your code editor doesn't support Typescript 2 yet or these types weren't listed in ```tsconfig.json```, add these to **"src/custom-typings.d.ts"** to make peace with the compile check: 
```es6
import '@types/gapi.youtube';
import '@types/gapi';
import '@types/youtube';
```

## Custom Type Definitions
When including 3rd party modules you also need to include the type definition for the module
if they don't provide one within the module. You can try to install it with @types

```
yarn add @types/node
yarn add @types/lodash
```

If you can't find the type definition in the registry we can make an ambient definition in
this file for now. For example

```typescript
declare module "my-module" {
  export function doesSomething(value: string): string;
}
```


If you're prototyping and you will fix the types later you can also declare it as type any

```typescript
declare var assert: any;
declare var _: any;
declare var $: any;
```

If you're importing a module that uses Node.js modules which are CommonJS you need to import as

```typescript
import * as _ from 'lodash';
```


# Frequently asked questions

  * please check out this repo to use the old version of protractor [#146](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/pull/146/files)
* Where do I write my tests?
  * You can write your tests next to your component files. See [`/src/app/home/home.component.spec.ts`](/src/app/home/home.component.spec.ts)
* How do I start the app when I get `EACCES` and `EADDRINUSE` errors?
  * The `EADDRINUSE` error means the port `3000` is currently being used and `EACCES` is lack of permission for webpack to build files to `./dist/`
* How to use `sass` for css?
 * `loaders: ['raw-loader','sass-loader']` and `@Component({ styleUrls: ['./filename.scss'] })` see issue [#136](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/issues/136)

 * Remove `node_modules/` and run `npm cache clean` then `npm install`
* How do I turn on Hot Module Replacement
 * Run `npm run server:dev:hmr`
* `RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded`
 * This is a problem with minifying Angular 4 and it's recent JIT templates. If you set `mangle` to `false` then you should be good.
* Why is the size of my app larger in development?
 * We are using inline source-maps and hot module replacement which will increase the bundle size.
